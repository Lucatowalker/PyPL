PyPL 1.0

This is a program built to prove a set of
premises and a conclusion provided in PL
by the user.
Mostly to help with my homework.
But that's beside the point.

Currently supported rules:
    Modus Ponens
    Modus Tollens

To run, double click PyPL.exe in the Windows folder
(Windows only. Mac version soon)
